<h2><a id="A_POSSIBLE_SOLUTION_OF_THE_NUMBER">A POSSIBLE SOLUTION OF THE NUMBER
SERIES ON PAGES 51 TO 58 OF THE
DRESDEN CODEX</a></h2>

<p class="center">DESCRIPTION</p>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the Dresden Codex, one of the three Maya manuscripts in existence,
there is found a series of numbers covering eight pages, 51
to 58 (plate I). As early as 1886, Dr. Förstemann recognized this
series as an important one, and one which probably referred to the
moon in some way. Each page is divided into an upper and a
lower half designated, respectively, “a” and “b.” Pages 51a
and 52a form a unit in themselves, but are clearly associated with
the remaining pages. The probable meaning of this group is still
so doubtful that it has been deemed best to omit entirely a discussion
of it at the present time. The remaining sections of these
pages form one long series of numbers which should be read from
left to right, beginning at 53a, reading to 58a, continuing on 51b,
and ending the series at 58b.</p>

<p>Each half-page is divided, horizontally, into four sections. The
upper section consists of two rows of hieroglyphs. The section
just below it contains a series of black numbers which increase in
value from left to right. The third section consists of three rows
of day glyphs with red numbers attached to them. The interval
between the glyphs in successive rows can, of course, be mathematically
obtained. The last, and bottom, division of the page is
filled with a series of black numbers which are of three values only,
namely, 177, 148, and 178, of which the first is the most frequent.
At more or less regular intervals a vertical strip is run from the
top of the half-page to the bottom. This strip contains, in the
upper part, eight or ten glyphs. Below them in all but the first
strip is a constellation band, and below that a figure of some kind.
These strips divide the number series into groups, and are called
“pictures,” occurring on ten of the fourteen half-pages. Considered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
vertically the pages are composed of columns. Each column
contains, beginning at the top, two hieroglyphs, a long number,
three day glyphs, and their numbers, and finally, at the bottom, a
short number. The pictures occur between these columns.</p>

<p>The series covers a period of 11,960 days, although the last
number recorded in the upper series is only 11,958. By means of
the columns this period of 11,960 days is divided into 69 unequal
parts. Let columns 2, 3, and 4 on page 54b be taken as examples.
Then each column in the series should be read in the following
manner:<a id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> The lower number of column 3 is 8.17 or 177. Add this
number to the upper number of column 2, which is 1. 2. 11. 9 or
8149. The result is 8326 which is expressed correctly as 1. 3. 2. 6
in the upper number of column 3. The lower number should also
be added to the upper day glyph of column 2, which is 10 Caban,
giving 5 Ix, which is the day glyph and number appearing as the
first in column 3. The second day glyph and number is that of the
day following 5 Ix, namely 6 Men. Similarly, 7 Cib is the day
after 6 Men. Going through the same process for column 4, 148,
that is, the lower number 7. 8 of that column, should be added to
8326 to obtain 8474, which is expressed in the upper number of
column 4 as 1. 3. 9. 14. Likewise, 148 days after 5 Ix comes 10 Ik,
which is the upper day glyph of column 4, and below which are
found the two days immediately following, namely, 11 Akbal
and 12 Kan.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>
<p>In short, then, the ideal arrangement of the series is as follows:
Each upper number is the sum of all the lower numbers of the
preceding columns and its own column. Each lower number
expresses the difference between the upper number of its own
column and that of the column immediately preceding it. The
day names and numbers are three horizontal series, each starting
a day later than the one above it, and recording three sets of day
names and numbers which would fit the series formed by the upper
numbers. It should be noticed that the mathematical interpretation
of the series does not appear to depend in any way upon the
hieroglyphs appearing at the top of the columns, or upon the
pictures.</p>

<p>This series deals quite clearly with synodical revolutions of the
moon. The entire series records 11,960 days, although the last
number in the upper series is only 11,958, a condition that will be
explained later. Four hundred and five synodical revolutions of
the moon consume, according to modern astronomy, 11,959.889
days, or about .11 of a day less than the length of the series. Moreover,
the difference groups 148, 177, and 178 which separate the
upper numbers, also record synodical months, for five months
consume 147.65 days, and six months 177.18 days. In fact the
correspondence between the numbers in the series and the synodical
months is so exact, that nowhere does an error of more than
one day exist.<a id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>Unfortunately the ideal arrangement given above is not followed
exactly. The actual series as it occurs in the manuscript appears
to be full of errors, a list of which will be found in Table I, p. 4.
Most of these errors have been pointed out and discussed repeatedly.<a id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
There still exists some doubt as to which numbers should
be considered errors of the original writer and which should be
taken at their face value. For this reason the errors are here discussed
in some detail, for in some cases the errors, or supposed
errors, affect theories in regard to the series.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In Table II, pp. 6, 7, both the corrected and the uncorrected series
are given. In the centre of the table are three columns containing
the actual table. The third column contains the uncorrected
upper number; the fourth the lower number; and the fifth the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
first day sign and its number. Since the other two day series
agree, except in a very few cases which will be mentioned later,
with the first series, they have been omitted from the table. The
sixth column contains the day signs as they probably should occur,
and the second contains the corrected upper number. The first
column gives the pages of the manuscript and the number of the
columns on each in order to facilitate reference to the manuscript.
Each column of Table II, with the exception of the first and
fourth, is composed of two series of numbers, since each interval
between the numbers of the manuscript has been placed in parentheses
after the last of the pair of numbers it deals with, in order<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
to facilitate comparison with the lower numbers. The names and
numbers in the fifth column which have parentheses have been
obliterated in the manuscript, but are easily inferred from the
other two rows of day signs and numbers.</p>

<p>The most prominent irregularity is the absence of the number
178 in the lower numbers when the differences in both the day
series and the upper numbers show that 178 should be the difference.
This occurs in columns 7, 14, 29, 37, 52 and 60 of the
manuscript. The only place in which 178 does occur in the lower
number is in column 23, when it agrees with the difference in the
day series, but not with that of the upper number. In other
words, the six occurrences of the 178-day group in the upper numbers
are neglected in the lower numbers, and the only occurrence
of 178 in the lower numbers does not agree with the upper numbers.
This implies that it is of deeper significance than a mere error.
There is another disagreement between the upper and lower numbers
which could very well be the result of carelessness. In
column 26, the lower number is 177, while both the upper number
and the day series give a difference of 148. This is the only case
in which the differences of 148 are not found at the same place in
all series, and, consequently, is probably an error of the scribe.
Again in the lower number of column 50, the careless omission
of one dot in the Uinal place has resulted in the record of 157
instead of the correct number, 177.</p>

<p>With one exception all of the errors in the upper numbers occur
in the first third of the series. That exception, i.e., the writing
of 4164 for 4163 in the column 24, may be explained by the fact
that the writer of the series had just added in column 23 the extra
day to the day series, which threw it out of agreement with the
upper numbers. For the moment this fact slipped his mind, but
he corrected the mistake by subtracting one day from the difference
between the upper numbers of columns 24 and 25.</p>

<p>The apparent error due to the addition of two dots in the Tun
place in the upper number of column 14 is more the result of an
error than an error in itself. This number shows a very clear case
of erasure. The writer of this section of the manuscript in copying
from the older source, at first overlooked column 14, and placed 7.3.18,
the upper number in column 15 in this place. Realizing his
mistake he erased the three dots in the Uinal place, but utilized<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
two of the bars and the three dots in the Kin place as the 13 needed
in the Uinal in column 14, and erased the lower bar of the original
18. This procedure of the writer’s threw the upper number of
column 14 out of alignment, for the two dots of the Kin appear
below the 13, somewhat below the line of Kins of the other columns.
The seven in the Tun place should have been a six, so the scribe
inserted an extra dot between the two of the original 7, neglecting,
however, to erase the other two dots. As a result the upper number
of column 14 records the number 3142, which is 720 greater
than it should be, namely, 2422.</p>

<p>In column 10, 1748 was recorded instead of 1742, for a bar and
three dots were written in the Kin place instead of only two dots.
This is a very peculiar and unexpected form of carelessness, which
is, however, corrected in the next column. The remaining irregularities
in the upper numbers are all due to the omission of a part
of the number. In columns 2 and 15, one dot was omitted in the
Kin place, thus recording 353 instead of 354 in the former, and
2598 instead of 2599 in the latter. In column 4 one bar was omitted
in the Kin place, making the number 674, five less than it should
be, namely, 679. In column 1, one dot was omitted in the Uinal
place, and in column 12, four dots of the same denomination, recording,
respectively, 157 and 2016 instead of 177 and 2096.</p>

<p>There is only one decided error in the day series. In column 11,
6 Cib, 7 Caban, 8 Eznab were written instead of 6 Cimi, 7 Manik,
8 Lamat. It should be noticed that the number of the day was
right. In fact just one-half a tonalamatl, or 130 days, was dropped
before the day series of column 11, and added on again immediately
afterwards. This is an extremely curious error to make in calculating
and may shed some light on the way in which the Mayas
reckoned.</p>

<p>The five remaining irregularities in the day series are of two
kinds. In column 5, the number preceding the third day, Chicchan,
is 4 instead of 11. Apparently the writer of the manuscript
forgot for the moment that the day was added to the one above
it and not the one to the left, and wrote 4 because the number associated
with the third day sign of column 4 was 3. The same
mistake was made in the third day of column 36, except that in
this case it was the day sign and not the number which was confused.
Here, instead of writing Ahau, which followed the Cauac<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
in the second series, Ben was recorded because the sign to the left
was Eb. The other three irregularities are all due to carelessness
in placing sufficient dots in the number associated with the day
sign, for in columns 17, 47 and 49, 1 Ik, 10 Eznab and 11 Kan were
recorded, respectively, instead of the necessary 2 Ik, 11 Eznab and
12 Kan.</p>

<p>There are two places in which columns seem to be misplaced,
although the mathematics of the series at these points is correct
as it stands. For the sake of uniformity in the arrangement of the
difference groups, the 178-day group of column 7 should occur in
column 6, and for the same reason, the 148-day group of column
58 should occur in column 59. Professor Förstemann calls both
of these variations errors, and arranges his version of the table so
that each part is just like the other two. He gives no reason for
his opinion other than the phrase “for the author [of the manuscript]
had confused the differences 178 and 148....”<a id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Mr.
Bowditch, on the other hand, allows both of the variations to
stand as they appear in the manuscript, and quite rightly holds
the opinion that, “It may possibly be that these numbers thus
placed are errors of the scribe, but the mere plea for uniformity is
not sufficient to lead us to make these changes.”<a id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>In Table II the apparent mistake in columns 58 and 59 remains
as it occurs in the manuscript, for the reason which Mr. Bowditch
gives. In the case of columns 6 and 7 there seems to be some evidence
that there actually was an error made. The last column on
page 53a, which is the one under discussion, contains no day glyph
in the first day series. The glyph should have been that of Ahau.
There is distinct evidence, altho very faint, that a glyph was once
there. Moreover, the smooth coating which covered the material
of the manuscript page is not broken. There are other obliterated
glyphs in these pages of the manuscript, but few in which the
surface, although unbroken, still contains a faint, almost continuous
outline of a glyph. The glyph, then, was probably erased.
The writer of the manuscript had probably completely finished
column 6 and started column 7 before he detected the error. He
began to erase the part that was wrong, then realized what an
amount of alteration would be necessary, and finally compromised
by making the difference come between columns 6 and 7 instead<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
of columns 5 and 6. This hypothesis in regard to the manner
in which the erasure was done may be wrong, but the erasure
still stands as a strong evidence to show that the 178 should have
occurred in column 6 rather than after it.</p>

<p>Finally there appears to be an error in the totals of the series,
for the upper number series records as a total 11,958 days and the
day series 11,959 days, although there is strong reason for believing
that the series should record 11,960 days. This discrepancy in
the totals will be referred to again.</p>

<p>In general, then, the apparent irregularities in the manuscript
fall into two great classes, those which are corrected in the next
column or are easily detected because of their disagreement with
the record in the other two series, and those which are not obviously
due to carelessness. The latter will be considered under the solutions.
The former may be dismissed as clerical errors not affecting
the solution. In this group are two of the irregularities in the
lower numbers (columns 26 and 50), and all eight in the upper
numbers, seven of which occur in the first third of the manuscript.
The six errors in the day series, and the transposition of columns
6 and 7, also belong in this class.</p>

<p>By referring to Table II it will be noticed that the pictures occur
after the 148-day groups in each case. The upper numbers immediately
preceding the pictures are given in Table III (p. 11),
together with the differences between them. By grouping these
differences, it becomes apparent that the pictures may be divided
into three large groups of 3986 days; two out of the three containing
the same difference numbers, 1742, 1034, and 1210. If, in the
last group, the number 10,039 were changed to 10,216 by adding
177, the differences for this group would also read as the others,
when the end of the series and the beginning of the series are added
together (708 + 502 = 1210), for the 10th picture is, in a sense,
out of the grouping since it occurs after the last number in the
series. The 148-day groups are arranged in the same order for
they occur in the same columns as the numbers used above.</p>

<p>By applying the same process to the 178-day groups, it is found
that they also can be divided into groups which contain 3986
days. In this case the second and third groups contain the same
numbers, 2598 and 1388 (Table IV). If the number 1211 in the
first group is changed to 1034 by subtracting 177, the last number<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
of this group would be 1388; and the first number 2598 could be
formed by adding the remainder at both ends of the series
(1564 + 1034 = 2598).</p>

<p>It should be remembered at this point that the only column in
which the lower numbers contained 178 is column 23, of which the
upper number is 3986. This gives further grounds for dividing
the series as it stands into three parts of 3986 days, each containing
23 columns.</p>

<p>The three parts are not exactly alike, however, as has already
  been pointed out in considering the probable errors. If the upper
  numbers and day numbers in column 6 should be altered, so that
  the difference 178 might occur in that column instead of column 7,
  and if, by the same process, the difference of 148 could occur in
  column 59 instead of 58, then the three parts of the series would be
  entirely alike. The three facts mentioned are, however, very strong
  evidence for supposing that the people who used this table considered
it as consisting of three equal parts.</p>

<p>This series in the Dresden is very similar to other pages of the
Dresden and other manuscripts, two examples of which are given
as illustrations. One of the most interesting parallels is the series
on pages 46-50 of this same manuscript. This series covers a
period of 2920 days which is divided into 20 unequal subdivisions.
On page 24, which just precedes page 46, this number is used as a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
unit in multiplication, that is, the numbers occurring on page 24
are separated from each other by 2920 or multiples of this number.
On pages 44b and 45b the number 78 is divided into four unequal
parts, and on pages 43b and 44b it is used as a unit in a series
which finally reaches the number 1940 × 78.</p>


<p class="center">SOLUTIONS</p>

<p>The first references to these pages in the manuscript were concerned
chiefly with the reading of the numbers without any
theories in regard to the probable meaning of the series.</p>

<p>Dr. Förstemann, in 1886, was probably the first to mention
these pages specifically. At this time he corrected many of the
errors in the series, and related the rows of days to the number
series.<a id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> He had already recognized a close relation between the
difference between the 1st and 9th pictures, i.e., 10,748, and the
Saturn sidereal period of 10,753 days. Of course, in order to do
this he had also identified the various signs in the “constellation
bands,” assigning them to various planets.<a id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> These identifications
are based on little more than the wish he had that they might
be those planets, and for that reason they are seriously open to
doubt.</p>

<p>Cyrus Thomas, two years later, also discussed this series at some
length, but confined his considerations entirely to the mathematical
side of the work. He also pointed out most of the errors, agreeing
in the main with Förstemann. He considered that the series
contained 11,960 days. In his conclusion he said “the sum of the
series as shown by the numbers over the second column of Plate
58b is 33 years, 3 months, and 18 days. As this includes only the
top day of this column (10 Cimi), we must add two days to complete
the series, which ends with 12 Lamat.”<a id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>During the following years, Dr. Förstemann repeatedly referred
to these pages in his publications and, in 1898, published an article
devoted to these pages alone.<a id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> The most detailed as well as the
final discussion of these pages is that given in his book on the
Dresden Codex.<a id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> In pages 53-58, and 51b and 52b he recognizes
the similarity to pages 46-50, and remarks that the Mayas not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
only combined the <i>tonalamatl</i> and the Mercury year, but also
attempted to bring the lunar revolution into accord with these
two. In other words, Förstemann seems to imply that the primary
purpose of the series was the counting of the Mercury years, and
that the lunar part of the problem was secondary.</p>

<p>He explains the number 11,958 as the result of attempts to make
the lunar count agree with 11,960. “They [the Mayas] found that
405 lunar revolutions amounted approximately to 11,958 days,
which is, in fact, the largest number on the second half page of
page 58.”<a id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> This will not stand at all as the reason for the 11,958
since 405 lunar revolutions come to 11,959.889 days, and if the
Mayas knew the revolutions accurately enough to know when to
intercalate a day, they most certainly would not have intentionally
formed the number 11,958, when they were perfectly well aware
of the fact that the time was more than 11,959 days. He recognizes
in the numbers 177, 148 and 178 multiples of lunar months of
29 and 30 days.</p>

<p>Dr. Förstemann at this time divides the series into the three
equal divisions in which it has since been considered. These are
of 3986 days, thus causing the intercalated days to come at the
same time in all three.<a id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> He also divided each of these three divisions
into three unequal groups of 1742, 1034, and 1210 days each.
He advances theories, based on the positions of the pictures in the
series, to show that the series also referred to the siderial periods
of Saturn and Jupiter, and discusses the meaning of the glyphs
found on these pages.</p>

<p>This detailed discussion by Dr. Förstemann of pages 51-58 of
the Dresden has been used as a foundation by many in further
studies of these pages. It is highly probable, however, that a
careful study of his interpretations will have to be made, in which
the proved assumptions must be clearly differentiated from those
in which the “wish is father to the thought.”</p>

<p>Mr. Bowditch, in 1910,<a id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> discussed these pages and their relation
to the astronomical knowledge of the Mayas. He divided the
series into the same groups as Dr. Förstemann, basing his division
upon the pictures which occur in every case immediately after
the number 148.<a id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> Mr. Bowditch brought out very clearly that this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
series is a lunar series, by means of a table which compares the
numbers recorded in the manuscript and the multiples of true
lunations.<a id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> There can be no question on this point, for the difference
between the recorded days and the true lunations is never
more than .9 of a day. He also pointed out a way in which this
series could be used over and over again in the form of a cycle,<a id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
and then discussed the relation of this series to the Saturn and
Mercury periods, disagreeing with Förstemann on several points.</p>

<p>Mr. Bowditch also pointed out a peculiar coincidence between
the synodical revolutions of Jupiter and the numbers in the series,
but based his argument on quite different material from the similar
theory of Dr. Förstemann’s. The important fact brought out is
that the three parts of the series under discussion are almost
exactly equal to 10 revolutions of Jupiter, for one revolution of
Jupiter consumes 398.867 days.<a id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> “This would give a reason for
the selection of 11,958 to 11,960 days or 405 revolutions, and for
the division of this number into three sections of 3986 days
each.”<a id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>Dr. Förstemann and Mr. Bowditch differ in regard to some of
the corrections which should be made in the manuscript, but on
the whole the two discussions of these pages supplement one
another. The general conclusion to be drawn from them is that
these pages of the Dresden are closely associated with the synodical
lunar month, and possibly, with the synodical revolution of Jupiter.</p>

<p>Three years after Mr. Bowditch’s discussion, Mr. Meinshausen
published an article in which the relation of this series to eclipses
was first brought out.<a id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> He compared, by means of two tables,
recorded eclipses of the 18th and 19th centuries with the numbers
in the Dresden Codex. Out of the 69 dates in the manuscript all
but 15 dates agreed with the first case, and, in the second, all but
13, due to the fact that all the eclipses are not visible at one place
on the earth’s surface. “Another indication that the numbers in
the codex have arisen from the observation of eclipses lies in the
fact that the exact grouping of the numbers which is induced by
the insertion of pictures in the number periods is also possible in
lunar eclipses which are visible at one particular point.”<a id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> In the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
table given to uphold this statement, the numbers, to be sure, can
be grouped in the manner which he suggests; but they can also
be grouped in other series. In his opinion the reason for the
grouping “lies in the close proximity of a solar eclipse to a lunar
eclipse,”<a id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> that is, that at the date at which the pictures are inserted
a solar eclipse occurred 15 days either before or after a
lunar eclipse. There are two facts which tend to uphold this
theory. One is the occurrence of the sun and the moon in shields
over nearly all pictures, which he interprets as “signs of solar and
lunar eclipses”; the other is the series of dates on pages 51a and
52a, which are 15 days apart. In a table of recorded eclipses proof
is given that such double eclipses can occur at the intervals which
separate the pictures in the manuscript. Since these intervals
vary a great deal, Meinshausen believes that they will form the
means of identifying the specific eclipses recorded in the manuscript.</p>

<p>His general conclusion is that “the material advanced will
prove sufficiently that these numbers are associated in some way
with solar and lunar eclipses, and this explanation must remain
standing at least until other numbers, corresponding equally remarkably,
are found.”<a id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>Professor R. W. Willson of the Astronomical Department of
Harvard University, working on a similar theory at about the
same time, had found, however, that no series of solar eclipses corresponding
to the intervals of the pictures in the text was visible
in Yucatan between the Christian era and the time of the Spanish
conquest.<a id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> This apparently invalidates Meinshausen’s theory.</p>

<p>Professor Willson believes that the table in the manuscript indicates
the days of ecliptic conjunction (that is, New Moon occurring
so near the moon’s node that eclipses <i>may</i> occur) and, as Mr.
Bowditch has shown, with a high degree of accuracy. Sufficient
proof of this, in Professor Willson’s opinion, is the close correspondence
of the intervals of the codex with the intervals of Schram’s
lunar table.<a id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>The similarity between the numbers in the Dresden and Schram’s
table is so remarkable that it seems advisable to point out some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
of the most outstanding features. In addition to giving the days
of multiples of the lunar synodic months, this table also gives the
time of possible occurrences of both solar and lunar eclipses.
Eclipses occur in cycles, the best known of which is the Saros,
although there are also smaller cycles which are not so accurate.
Table V (p. 17) gives the occurrences of central solar eclipses according
to Schram. It should be noticed that they occur in groups
of threes and fours, each set being separated from the preceding
one by 29 synodical months. The numbers in each group are only
six months apart. Table VI (p. 17) is a corresponding series of
lunar eclipses, which also occur in a grouping similar to that of the
solar eclipses. It should be noticed in passing that the first numbers
of these groups, in both the solar and lunar eclipses are separated
by 47 and 41 lunations, the latter occurring after every
third group in Table V.</p>

<p>Table VII (p. 17) contains the numbers which are in the same
columns as the 178-day groups in the Dresden. By comparing
Table V and Table VII, it will be found that the numbers in the
Dresden are the same as the first numbers in groups 1, 2, 4, 5, 7 and
8 of the solar eclipses. In the last two numbers there is a difference
of one day, which is explained by recalling the addition of an extra
day in the day series but not in the upper numbers of the Dresden.
If 679 days are added to each number in Table VII, which amounts
to the same thing as advancing the Dresden table 679 days with
respect to Schram’s table, it will be found that these numbers will
also agree with the first numbers in groups 2, 3, 5, 6 and 8 and
with the second number in group 9 of the lunar eclipses, in Table
VI. A similar agreement may be observed for the 148-day groups
(see Table III).</p>

<p>This remarkable agreement between the 178-day groups in the
Dresden and the occurrences of eclipses may have several meanings.
(1) One possibility, and one which should always be kept in
mind, is that this agreement is simply another coincidence, of
which there are always many in chronological work. (2) It may
be that the numbers refer to dates of prophesied eclipses which the
Mayas had learned occurred at more or less regular intervals.
(3) Since this table has a place in the calendar of the Mayas (for
a date probably occurs on page 52a), it may be that these numbers
refer to definite historical eclipses. If they do, they will afford a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
means by which an absolute correlation between the Maya and
the Julian calendars may be obtained. Professor Willson is at
present working on this problem.</p>

<p>In order to determine the exact extent to which the eclipse seasons
affect these pages in the Dresden Codex it is necessary to work
out in as great detail as possible the calendar represented.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>Modern astronomy shows that the synodical revolution of the
moon consumes 29.53059 days, about .03 days more than 29&frac12;
days. Since a calendar must be based on whole days the natural
method of combining the months would be to alternate one of 29
days with one of 30 days. At the end of two months or 59 days
the true synodical month would be in advance of the calendrical
month by .06118 days. Every two months this error is doubled
so that at the end of 34 months the calendar would have completed
1003 days and the synodical month 1004.04 days. (See Table
VIII, p. 19.) One method of correcting this would be to make the
last month a 30-day month instead of one of 29 days as it would be
by simple alternation. This 34-month period could then be repeated
as a cycle with an accumulating error of .04 days at
every repetition.</p>

<p>Such a series utterly disregards, however, all other phenomena
such as eclipses, seasons, etc. As soon as eclipses are considered
the arrangement of the months must be altered in order to use the
periodicity of eclipses in the calendar. Eclipses occur at regular
seasons, approximately six months apart. The average interval
between eclipse seasons is 173.310 days, 3.874 days less than six
synodical lunar months. In Table IX (p. 20) the eclipse season
is compared with the nearest synodical lunar month. It will be
noticed that the difference increases between the two series until
it is necessary to use five synodical months for one interval instead
of six to keep the difference less than half a month. It is necessary
to do this three times in 135 synodical months, or 3986.630 days,
which exceed 23 eclipse seasons, or 3986.131 days, by practically
one half-day. It would be most logical to drop these extra months
out of the set of six, during that group in which the difference tends
to become most nearly half a month. That would be just before
the 23d, 70th, and 117th month, that is, 47 months apart, requiring
41 months to complete the 135-month period.</p>


<p>This series of 135 lunar months, or 23 eclipse seasons, can be repeated
almost indefinitely, alternating 3986 and 3987 days to the
series and still keep the synodical month in accord with the eclipse
season. But another factor must also be considered. Months of
29 and 30 days cannot be simply alternated and either conform
with the true synodical month or complete the ecliptic series mentioned,
for 3986 contains three more days than sixty-eight 30-day<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
months, and sixty-seven 29-day months. Therefore in the 3986
series three of the 29-day months must be changed to 30-day
months, and in the 3987 series four must be changed. The position
of these changes is arbitrary. They can, for example, be the
34th, 68th, and 102d months, and when necessary, the 134th.</p>

<p>The next logical step is a comparison between the theoretical
calendars just described and the manuscript. A study of the manuscript
reveals that: (1) the series recorded represents 405 lunar
months or three times 135 months, and that the series naturally
falls into three great subdivisions of 3986 days each; (2) each<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
third consists of 23 columns or unequal subdivisions; (3) the intervals
between the 178-day groups are 47 and 88 months; (4) the
148-day groups fall approximately at 47 and 41 month intervals
(see Table X); (5) the first 178-day group in each third occurs
between the 30th and 35th month inclusive, and the other 178-day
group of the third comes 47 months later. Since the number
178 is composed of four 30-and two 29-day months, an extra day
must have been added, that is, a 30-day month was substituted
for one of the 29-day months, if the manuscript represents a regular
alternating series.</p>

<p>The obvious conclusions to be drawn from these facts are:
(1) that the series was divided into three groups of 3986 days each
in order to associate the lunar calendar closely with the ecliptic
cycle of the same length; (2) that the 23 columns in each third
may represent the twenty-three eclipse seasons in each eclipse
period of 3986 days; (3) that groups of 47 and 41 months were
used in some way in the series, for the 178-day groups are separated
by 47 and 88 months and 88 is composed of 47 and 41, the
two periods so closely associated with the recurrence of eclipses;
(4) that the six months period was changed to one of five months of
148 days approximately every 47 and 41 months, which is the
method already advanced in the theoretical ecliptic lunar series
for keeping the synodical months and ecliptic seasons together;
(5) that one extra day was added to the alternating 29-and 30-day
months, between the 30th and 35th month inclusive of each
third, in accordance with the theoretical necessity for so doing
already brought out, and that another of the three extra days
was added 47 months later.</p>

<p>When the difference groups<a id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> are divided into months it is found
that it is an easy matter to arrange the months in an alternating
series. The group of 177 days is composed of three 30-and three
29-day months, either of which when alternated can begin the
group, which then ends with the other, i.e., 29, 30, 29, 30, 29, 30,
or 30, 29, 30, 29, 30, 29. The group of 148 days consists of three
30-and two 29-day months, necessitating that it begin and end
with a 30-day month when alternated, thus, 30, 29, 30, 29, 30.
In the 178-day group one of the 29-day months is replaced by a
30-day month, otherwise the group is exactly like that of 177 days,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
which it exceeds by one day. It is evident that there will always
be three 30-day months in succession in the 178-day group, and
that care must be taken in choosing the right sequence of the 177-day
groups which fall near those of 148 days in order to avoid having
two 30-day months in succession.</p>

<p>There remains simply the substitution of the six or five months,
as the case may be, in place of the difference groups in the manuscript.
However, if the Mayas considered each third of the table
as a unit, it is reasonable to assume that the sequence of the months
in each third is identical. Therefore it is necessary to arrange a
sequence for only one-third, that is, 135 months, and then, if the
assumption is correct, this sequence will fit the other two-thirds of
the series.</p>

<p>Each third of the table consists of 135 months covering three
more days than would be covered by a simple alternation of 30-and
29-day months. These three intercalary days were inserted
at definite intervals. A clue to the position of two of them is given
by the 178-day groups. One was inserted between the 30th and
35th months, another 47 months later, between the 77th and 82d
months. Theoretically the extra day should be inserted in the
34th month after the beginning of a series of alternating 29-and
30-day months, for then the error between the synodical revolution
of the moon and the calendrical months becomes more than
one day. In the 29-day month preceding the 34th, namely the
32d month, the error at the end is also practically one day, i.e.,
.98 days. The 29-day month most nearly the centre of the first
178-day group is the 32d month of the series, the third in the
group. The Mayas may have chosen this month because of its
position in the 178-day group, making the sequence of the months
29, 30, 30, 30, 29, 30, if the 30th month was a 29-day month as it
would be by simple alternation.</p>

<p>The second time this intercalary day occurs in each third is 47
months later. Obviously, this may be the recurrence of this intercalation
in a repetition of a smaller group of months than the 135-month
group. If 47 months are subtracted from the 79th month
which is the third in the second 178-day group the result is 32,
which implies that the smaller division is 47 months. Two 47-month
periods complete all but 41 of the 135 months in each third.
Then, of necessity, if each third of the manuscript is a unit, a 41-month<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
group follows two 47-month groups, an arrangement which
also agrees with the eclipse groups in Tables V.</p>

<p>The two 178-day groups account for only two of the three intercalated
days, and since no 178-day group occurs in the 41-month
division, the addition of this day must have been accomplished in
some more obscure manner. Since both 47 and 41 are odd numbers,
each group must contain at least one more month of one kind
than the other. Since two synodical revolutions of the moon are
slightly longer than two calendrical months it is wisest to start and
end each group with a 30-day month. If this is done, the 47-month
group will contain twenty-five 30-day and twenty-two 29-day
months, and the 41-month group twenty-one 30-day and twenty
29-day months, making for the composition of the 135 months,
seventy-one 30-day and sixty-four 29-day months, that is, seven
more of the 30-day months than of those of 29 days, showing that
actually three of the sixty-seven 29-day months expected in a
normal repetition have become 30-day months. This is caused by
the occurrence of two 30-day months in succession at the end of
one series and the beginning of the next. If the 135 months in
each third are numbered in succession it will be seen that in the
first 47-month group and in the 41-month group, the 30-day months
are the odd numbers. In the second 47-month group they are the
even numbers, of which there is one more in this division than odd
numbers, thus accounting for the additional one of the three days.</p>

<p>If the period of 3986 days were considered by itself, the arrangement
given would be sufficient. As soon, however, as this period
is repeated a number of times an error develops, since 135 synodical
revolutions of the moon are completed in 3986.63 days. Twice
this number gives 7973.26, or 1.26 days more than twice 3986.
In order to keep the sequence of months in the arrangement given
above in accordance with the moon, it becomes necessary to intercalate
one more day every two repetitions of the 3986 period.
This may be done by changing the last 29-day month in the 41-month
group to a 30-day month, making the last 177-day group
in the third one of 178 days. The Mayas certainly did this in the
first third of the series given and arranged for it in the last third
in a manner which will be demonstrated later.</p>

<p>Tabulating the solution here advanced will form Table XI
(p. 25), in which the 30-and 29-day months in one-third of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
manuscript have been arranged in three columns, the first two of
which represent the 47-month groups and the last one the 41-month
group. Before the first column of months are numbers to
facilitate locating any given month in the group. The two kinds
of months occur in direct alternation in each group, with three
exceptions. The 32d month in both of the 47-month groups is one
of 30 days instead of 29, because of the addition of the intercalary
day. The 40th month in the 41-month group is given as one of
29 days with a 30 in parentheses before it, representing the fact
that every other third an extra intercalary day should be inserted
in this month. To the right of the month columns are three columns
giving the difference groups as found in the manuscript (see
Table II), each column giving those numbers found in each third
of the manuscript, the first third being the left one of the three.
It should be noticed that the misplaced (?) 148-day group in the
last third does not interfere with the sequence of the months.</p>

<p>Finally it only remains to review the irregularities of the manuscript
in the light of the solution just advanced. Those irregularities
which are corrected immediately afterwards, or are at variance
with the rest of the column in which they occur, are, in all probability,
errors on the part of the writer of the series, such as might
have been caused by careless transcription from another copy of
the table, and correction in the following column to avoid the task
of erasure. Eliminating these irregularities, there remain three
to be investigated, namely, (1) the absence of the 178 numbers in
the lower number series, with one conspicuous exception; (2) the
occurrence of 178 in column 7 instead of 6, and of 148 in column
58 instead of 59; and (3) the discrepancies in the totals of the
series.</p>

<p>The great bulk of the difference groups as expressed by the lower
number series are 177, the only departure from these being the
designation of the 148-day groups and the extra 178-day group at
the end of the first third. The complete disregard of all of the six
normal 178-day groups by the lower numbers seems to imply that
no attempt was made to have the latter agree with the actual differences
in the upper numbers, a conclusion which is strengthened
by the fact that none of the lower numbers shows evidence of the
clerical errors in the differences of the upper numbers. It seems
most probable that the lower number series was intended merely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
as a guide to indicate the position of the five month periods and to
place emphasis on the extra intercalary day added in the 23d column,
without attempting to have this series accurate.</p>

<p>The presence of the 178-day group in column 7 instead of 6 has
been discussed at some length under the description of the errors.
The scribe, realizing that in neglecting to put in this 178-day
group, the first one of the series, a serious error had been committed,
may have attempted to erase the incorrect record in
column 6; then, realizing that four numbers and three glyphs
would have to be altered, decided to correct this mistake—although
it was of more importance than the other two errors—as he had
the former ones, i.e., by making the correction in the next column.</p>

<p>The very similar irregularity in the last third of the manuscript,
the placing of the 148-day group one column ahead of its expected
position, cannot be explained in the same manner. It is very evident
that this column has been deliberately placed where it is. That
it does not have to do with the month sequence is evident, since it
does not affect it. It must then affect the ecliptic part of the series,
for it causes a short season to occur six months earlier than expected.
Upon comparison of Tables VI and X, it will be seen that
all of the dates of the 148-day group occur during one of the eclipse
groups given in Schram’s table. However, had the 148-day group
under discussion been placed in the 59th column, as uniformity demands,
this number, 10,216, would not have fallen in one of the
eclipse groups given in Table VI. This tends to show that there
was some reason other than regulating the difference groups to
agree with the eclipse seasons, for the position of the 148-day
groups. This reason, as yet undetermined, is possibly associated
with the pictures, which immediately follow the 148-day groups.</p>

<p>Finally there remain only the totals of the series to be considered.
The total of the upper number series records 11,958 days. Sixty-nine
eclipse seasons complete 11,958.39 days, less than half a day
more than the recorded number. This close agreement and the
failure to add the extra intercalary day to the upper number series
at the end of the first third, give rise to the belief that the upper
number series is a calendar in itself, and records a means by which
dates of probable eclipses may be reckoned. The units of the
count were eclipse seasons expressed as lunar months, 69 of
which are represented in the calendar recorded on these pages.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>The Mayas undoubtedly knew the relation of the eclipses to the
moon, at least in a vague way, and felt that it was necessary to
associate this eclipse calendar in some way with the lunar calendar,
composed of 29-and 30-day months. Therefore the day series is
found immediately below the upper number series. This series of
days constitutes a lunar calendar which coincides as closely as
possible with the eclipse calendar. It may be the formal lunar
calendar of the Mayas, but it may also be an adaptation of the
formal calendar to the eclipse periods. The day series varies from
the eclipse series in two places only. At the end of the first third
of the series, it was necessary to add one day to the lunar calendar,
an addition strongly pointed out in the record, but not to the
eclipse calendar, because of the increasing error between the revolutions
of the moon and the calendrical lunar months. Therefore,
throughout the remaining two-thirds of the series, the lunar calendar
was one day in advance of the eclipse calendar. At the end
of the series, since 405 of the moon’s revolutions complete 11,959.89
days, and the day series only 11,959, one more day should be added,
in order to keep the error as small as possible. This was accomplished
by changing from the middle to the lower line of days.</p>

<p>On page 52a, immediately preceding the calendar, are four day
signs with numbers. One of these, 12 Lamat, is the zero day of
the day series, but is associated with the middle line of day glyphs
and not the upper line, as might be expected. The series of days
which come, calendrically speaking, just before and after the actual
series, may have been placed in the record to show that slight
variations from the average were to be expected. The entire
record is based on the middle line of days until the end of the series.
Here the day just below the last day of the middle line is 12 Lamat,
the end of 46 <i>tonalamatls</i> (260-day cycle), and the zero day of the
recorded series. The <i>tonalamatl</i> was probably as easily used by
the Mayas as “60 days” and “90 days” are used now. The entire
calendrical system of the Mayas is based on the cycle principle.
The series recorded in these pages was probably also a cycle, and
in order to repeat it, 12 Lamat must again be used as the zero
date. If to these arguments is added the fact that an additional
day is necessary to keep the calendar in accord with the synodic
revolution of the moon, there remains little doubt but that the
users of this calendar added the extra day by going from the middle<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
to the lower line of day glyphs, thereby keeping the error between
the moon and the calendar as low as possible, completing the 46th
<i>tonalamatl</i>, and at the same time making it possible to repeat the
recorded series as a cycle. If the series is repeated once, at the end
of 810 months, or about 66&frac12; years, the eclipse calendar will be
behind the average eclipse season .78 days, and the lunar calendar
will be in advance of the synodical revolutions of the moon only
.22 days.</p>

<p>In general, then, the irregularities in the calendar recorded on
these pages fall into two groups, those which are clerical errors of
the scribe and do not therefore affect the solution advanced, and
those which do not appear to be of the clerical type. In the light
of the solution advanced, it has been shown that there are perfectly
logical reasons for the latter group of apparent irregularities.</p>


<p class="center">CONCLUSION</p>

<p>On pages 51 to 58 of the Dresden Codex occurs a series of numbers,
running continuously through all the pages except the upper
halves of the first two. This series records a period of 11,960 days,
divided by means of columns into sixty-nine unequal subdivisions,
of 177, 148, and 178 days, of which the first is the most frequent.</p>

<p>There are three distinct series. One series of numbers is in the
upper part of the record, and consists of totals increased step by
step until the final total reached records 11,958 days. Just below
this series are three series of day signs and numbers, the middle
one of which is the actual series. These dates are separated by the
same number of days as the upper number series, except in the
23d group, at which place one extra day is added to the day series
and not to the upper number series, causing the former to be in
advance of the latter one day throughout the remainder of the
record. At the end of the day series another extra day is added by
counting in the last day in the lower row of days, thus completing
the 11,960-day period.</p>

<p>Below this day series is another number series no term of which
exceeds 178. In a general way it records the differences between
the dates appearing above each of its numbers. The agreement is
however so inaccurate that this lower number series could, at best,
have been used only as a general guide to the user of the manuscript,
in that it calls attention to the intervals of unusual length.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>The series recorded is composed of three equal parts, each composed
of 23 subdivisions and covering 3986 days.</p>

<p>The number series on these pages record an eclipse calendar,
that is, a series of dates by means of which the occurrence of
eclipses was foretold. This calendar is composed of three identical
parts, with the exception of one 148-day group which occurs
six months earlier in the last third than in the other two. Each
third is composed of 23 unequal subdivisions which represent the
twenty-three eclipse seasons, expressed in lunar months, in 3986
days. The upper number series records this calendar, and its
total of 11,958 days is only .39 days less than 69 eclipse seasons.</p>

<p>In order to make it more intelligible this eclipse calendar is accompanied
by a probably more generally known lunar calendar,
which may have been altered slightly to conform to the requirements
of the eclipse calendar it accompanies. This lunar calendar
is contained in the day series just below the eclipse calendar. It
also is recorded in three divisions agreeing closely with the eclipse
calendar. One hundred and thirty-five lunar months of 30 and 29
days complete 3986 days, .63 days less than 135 synodical revolutions
of the moon. This error which amounts to more than
one day when repeated once, necessitates the addition of an extra
day in the lunar calendar every other third, which was done in the
manuscript in the first and last third, making the total recorded by
the lunar calendar 11,960, two days more than the eclipse calendar,
and .11 days more than 405 synodical revolutions of the moon.
This period of 11,960 days may have been used as a cycle, the
zero day of which is 12 Lamat.</p>

<p>Each third of the lunar calendar consists of 30-and 29-day
months arranged in alternating sequence, with intercalary days
added by the substitution of a 30-day for a 29-day month when
the error arising from the nonconformity of the moon’s revolution
reaches more than one day. In order that the lunar calendar
might agree with the eclipse calendar more closely, these months
were recorded in groups of five and six.</p>

<p>The months in each third of the series were divided into three
groups, which are the same in each third. The first two groups
contained 47 months each, and completed the first sixteen dates
of the third. The last group was one of 41 months, which was
represented by the last seven dates of the third. An intercalary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
day was added in the 32d month of each of the 47-month groups
to correct the accumulating error, thereby causing the 6th and 14th
subdivisions of the third to be of 178 days. In the first and last
third the 40th month of the 41-month group also contained an intercalary
day for the same reason, making the 23d subdivision 178
days, but in the last column of the record this extra day is added
by going from the middle to the lower line of day signs. Each of
the 47-and 41-month divisions began and ended with a month of
thirty days.</p>

<p>The numerical series of these pages of the Dresden record, then,
an eclipse calendar which is referred to a lunar calendar. This
solution explains all the irregularities of the series except those
which seem clearly to be clerical errors of the scribe.</p>

<p>Only the numerical and calendrical series on these pages have
been considered. No attempt has been made to explain the hieroglyphs,
the pictures, or the first two pages, which, although showing
a close association to the long series, are nevertheless a unit in
themselves.</p>

<div class="footnotes" id="footnotes"><h3>FOOTNOTES:</h3>


<div class="footnote">
<p><a id="Footnote_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> For those unacquainted with Maya arithmetic the following points will explain matters:
the Mayas used the vigesimal system of enumeration; they counted by twenties instead of
tens. A bar represented five, and a dot stood for one. They represented numbers larger than
twenty by position, just as we do. However, instead of having the smallest denomination at
the right and the largest at the left of a horizontal series of figures, they had the smallest at
the bottom and the largest at the top of a column of numbers. Instead of each unit in a given
position representing ten times the value of that of the preceding position, it represented
twenty times the value, except in the third position where it was only eighteen times as great.
Thus each unit of the bottom number represented one (Kin), that of the number above it
twenty (Uinal), that of the third number 20 × 18 or 360 (Tun), that of the fourth position
20 × 360 or 7200 (Katun), etc. For ease in handling, these numbers are written in our script
with arabic numerals, the bottom number on the right, and separated by periods. Thus in
column three, page 53a, the upper number is 1. 7. 2, which means that the kin of this group
is 2, the Uinal 7, (7 × 20) and the Tun 1 (1 × 360), making in all 2 + 140 + 360 or 502.
</p>
<p>
The Maya calendar, like ours, consisted of a series of numbers and a series of names for each
day, each series repeating itself constantly, irrespective of the other. There were twenty
different day names, which remained in an unchangeable order, and thirteen numbers. In
the pages under discussion these day names appear as glyphs preceded by the necessary
number.
